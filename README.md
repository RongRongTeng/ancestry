# Ancestry

Ancestry is a gem that allows the records of a Ruby on Rails
ActiveRecord model to be organised as a tree structure (or hierarchy). It employs
the materialised path pattern and exposes all the standard tree structure
relations (ancestors, parent, root, children, siblings, descendants), allowing all
of them to be fetched in a single SQL query. Additional features include STI
support, scopes, depth caching, depth constraints, easy migration from older
gems, integrity checking, integrity restoration, arrangement of
(sub)trees into hashes, and various strategies for dealing with orphaned
records.

NOTE:

- Ancestry 2.x supports Rails 4.1 and earlier
- Ancestry 3.x supports Rails 5.0 and 4.2
- Ancestry 4.0 only supports rails 5.0 and higher

# Installation

Follow these steps to apply Ancestry to any ActiveRecord model:

## Add to Gemfile

```ruby
# Gemfile

gem 'ancestry'
```

```bash
$ bundle install
```

## Add ancestry column to your table

```bash
$ rails g migration add_ancestry_to_[table] ancestry:string:index
# or use different column name of your choosing. e.g. name:
# rails g migration add_name_to_[people] name:string:index
```

```ruby
class AddAncestryToTable < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
  def change
    change_table(:table) do |t|
      # postgrel
      t.string "ancestry", collation: 'C', null: false
      t.index "ancestry"
      # mysql
      t.string "ancestry", collation: 'utf8mb4_bin', null: false
      t.index "ancestry"
    end
  end
end
```

There are additional options for the columns in [Ancestry Database Columnl](#ancestry-database-column) and
an explanation for `opclass` and `collation`.

```bash
$ rake db:migrate
```

NOTE: A Btree index (as is recommended) has a limitaton of 2704 characters for the ancestry column. This means you can't have an tree with a depth that is too great (~> 900 items at most).

## Configure ancestry defaults

```ruby
# config/initializers/ancestry.rb

# use the newer format
Ancestry.default_ancestry_format = :materialized_path2
# Ancestry.default_update_strategy = :sql
```

## Add ancestry to your model

```ruby
# app/models/[model.rb]

class [Model] < ActiveRecord::Base
   has_ancestry
end
```

Your model is now a tree!

# Using acts_as_tree instead of has_ancestry

In version 1.2.0, the **acts_as_tree** method was **renamed to has_ancestry**
in order to allow usage of both the acts_as_tree gem and the ancestry gem in a
single application. The `acts_as_tree` method will continue to be supported in the future.

# Organising records into a tree

You can use the parent attribute to organise your records into a tree. If you
have the id of the record you want to use as a parent and don't want to fetch
it, you can also use parent_id. Like any virtual model attributes, parent and
parent_id can be set using parent= and parent_id= on a record or by including
them in the hash passed to new, create, create!, update_attributes and
update_attributes!. For example:

`TreeNode.create! :name => 'Stinky', :parent => TreeNode.create!(:name => 'Squeeky')`.

Children can be created through the children relation on a node: `node.children.create :name => 'Stinky'`.

# Tree Navigation

The node with the large border is the reference node (the node from which the navigation method is invoked.)
The yellow nodes are those returned by the method.

# `has_ancestry` options

The has_ancestry method supports the following options:

    :ancestry_column       Pass in a symbol to store ancestry in a different column
    :ancestry_format       Ancestry format (see Ancestry Formats section):
                           :materialized_path (default) 1/2/3, root nodes ancestry=nil
                           :materialized_path2  /1/2/3/, root nodes ancestry=/
    :orphan_strategy       Instruct Ancestry what to do with children of a node that is destroyed:
                           :destroy   All children are destroyed as well (default)
                           :rootify   The children of the destroyed node become root nodes
                           :restrict  An AncestryException is raised if any children exist
                           :adopt     The orphan subtree is added to the parent of the deleted node
                                      If the deleted node is Root, then rootify the orphan subtree
    :cache_depth           Cache the depth of each node in the 'ancestry_depth' column (default: false)
                           If you turn depth_caching on for an existing model:
                           - Migrate: add_column [table], :ancestry_depth, :integer, :default => 0
                           - Build cache: TreeNode.rebuild_depth_cache!
    :depth_cache_column    Pass in a symbol to store depth cache in a different column
    :primary_key_format    Supply a regular expression that matches the format of your primary key
                           By default, primary keys only match integers ([0-9]+)
    :touch                 Instruct Ancestry to touch the ancestors of a node when it changes, to
                           invalidate nested key-based caches. (default: false)
    :counter_cache         Boolean whether to create counter cache column accessor.
                           Default column name is `children_count`.
                           Pass symbol to use different column name (default: false)
    :update_strategy       Choose the strategy to update descendants nodes (default: `ruby`)
                           :ruby     All descendants are updated using the ruby algorithm. This strategy
                                     triggers update callbacks for each descendants nodes
                           :sql      All descendants are updated using a single SQL statement. This strategy
                                     does not trigger update callbacks for the descendants. This strategy is
                                     available only for PostgreSql implementations

# (Named) Scopes

The navigation methods return scopes instead of records, where possible. Additional ordering,
conditions, limits, etc. can be applied and the results can be retrieved, counted, or checked for existence:

```ruby
node.children.where(:name => 'Mary').exists?
node.subtree.order(:name).limit(10).each { ... }
node.descendants.count
```

A couple of class-level named scopes are included:

    roots                   Root nodes
    ancestors_of(node)      Ancestors of node, node can be either a record or an id
    children_of(node)       Children of node, node can be either a record or an id
    descendants_of(node)    Descendants of node, node can be either a record or an id
    indirects_of(node)      Indirect children of node, node can be either a record or an id
    subtree_of(node)        Subtree of node, node can be either a record or an id
    siblings_of(node)       Siblings of node, node can be either a record or an id

It is possible thanks to some convenient rails magic to create nodes through the children and siblings scopes:

    node.children.create
    node.siblings.create!
    TestNode.children_of(node_id).new
    TestNode.siblings_of(node_id).create

# Selecting nodes by depth

With depth caching enabled (see has_ancestry options), an additional five named
scopes can be used to select nodes by depth:

    before_depth(depth)     Return nodes that are less deep than depth (node.depth < depth)
    to_depth(depth)         Return nodes up to a certain depth (node.depth <= depth)
    at_depth(depth)         Return nodes that are at depth (node.depth == depth)
    from_depth(depth)       Return nodes starting from a certain depth (node.depth >= depth)
    after_depth(depth)      Return nodes that are deeper than depth (node.depth > depth)

Depth scopes are also available through calls to `descendants`,
`descendant_ids`, `subtree`, `subtree_ids`, `path` and `ancestors` (with relative depth).
Note that depth constraints cannot be passed to `ancestor_ids` or `path_ids` as both relations
can be fetched directly from the ancestry column without needing a query. Use
`ancestors(depth_options).map(&:id)` or `ancestor_ids.slice(min_depth..max_depth)` instead.

    node.ancestors(:from_depth => -6, :to_depth => -4)
    node.path.from_depth(3).to_depth(4)
    node.descendants(:from_depth => 2, :to_depth => 4)
    node.subtree.from_depth(10).to_depth(12)

# STI support

To use with STI: create a STI inheritance hierarchy and build a tree from the different
classes/models. All Ancestry relations that were described above will return nodes of any model type. If
you do only want nodes of a specific subclass, a type condition is required.

# Arrangement

A subtree can be arranged into nested hashes for easy navigation after database retrieval.
`TreeNode.arrange` could, for instance, return:

```ruby
{
  #<TreeNode id: 100018, name: "Stinky", ancestry: nil> => {
    #<TreeNode id: 100019, name: "Crunchy", ancestry: "100018"> => {
      #<TreeNode id: 100020, name: "Squeeky", ancestry: "100018/100019"> => {}
    },
    #<TreeNode id: 100021, name: "Squishy", ancestry: "100018"> => {}
  }
}
```

The `arrange` method can work on a scoped class (`TreeNode.find_by(:name => 'Crunchy').subtree.arrange`),
and can take ActiveRecord find options. If you want ordered hashes, pass the order to the method instead of
the scope as follows:

`TreeNode.find_by(:name => 'Crunchy').subtree.arrange(:order => :name)`.

The `arrange_serializable` method returns the arranged nodes as a nested array of hashes. Order
can be passed in the same fashion as to the `arrange` method:
`TreeNode.arrange_serializable(:order => :name)` The result can easily be serialized to json with `to_json`
or other formats. You can also supply your own serialization logic with blocks.

Using `ActiveModel` serializers:

`TreeNode.arrange_serializable { |parent, children| MySerializer.new(parent, children: children) }`.

Or plain hashes:

```ruby
TreeNode.arrange_serializable do |parent, children|
  {
     my_id: parent.id,
     my_children: children
  }
end
```

# Sorting

The `sort_by_ancestry` class method: `TreeNode.sort_by_ancestry(array_of_nodes)` can be used
to sort an array of nodes as if traversing in preorder. (Note that since materialised path
trees do not support ordering within a rank, the order of siblings is
dependant upon their original array order.)


# Ancestry Database Column

## Collation Indexes

Sorry, using collation or index operator classes makes this a little complicated. The
root of the issue is that in order to use indexes, the ancestry column needs to
compare strings using ascii rules.

It is well known that `LIKE '/1/2/%'` will use an index because the wildchard (i.e.: `%`)
is on the right hand side of the `LIKE`. While that is true for ascii strings, it is not
necessarily true for unicode. Since ancestry only uses ascii characters, telling the database
this constraint will optimize the `LIKE` statemens.

## Collation Sorting

As of 2018, standard unicode collation ignores punctuation for sorting. This ignores
the ancestry delimiter (i.e.: `/`) and returns data in the wrong order. The exception
being Postgres on a mac, which ignores proper unicode collation and instead uses
ISO-8859-1 ordering (read: ascii sorting).

Using the proper column storage and indexes will ensure that data is returned from the
database in the correct order. It will also ensure that developers on Mac or Windows will
get the same results as linux production servers, if that is your setup.

## Migrating Collation

If you are reading this and want to alter your table to add collation to an existing column,
remember to drop existing indexes on the `ancestry` column and recreate them.

## ancestry_format materialized_path and nulls

If you are using the legacy `ancestry_format` of `:materialized_path`, then you need to the
collum to allow `nulls`. Change the column create accordingly: `null: true`.

Chances are, you can ignore this section as you most likely want to use `:materialized_path2`.

## Postgres Storage Options

### ascii field collation

The currently suggested way to create a postgres field is using `'C'` collation:

```ruby
t.string "ancestry", collation: 'C', null: false
t.index "ancestry"
```

### ascii index

If you need to use a standard collation (e.g.: `en_US`), then use an ascii index:

```ruby
t.string "ancestry", null: false
t.index  "ancestry", opclass: :varchar_pattern_ops
```

This option is mostly there for users who have an existing ancestry column and are more
comfortable tweaking indexes rather than altering the ancestry column.

### binary column

When the column is binary, the database doesn't convert strings using locales.
Rails will convert the strings and send byte arrays to the database.
At this time, this option is not suggested. The sql is not as readable, and currently
this does not support the `:sql` update_strategy.

```ruby
t.binary "ancestry", limit: 3000, null: false
t.index  "ancestry"
```
You may be able to alter the database to gain some readability:

```SQL
ALTER DATABASE dbname SET bytea_output to 'escape';
```

## Mysql Storage options

### ascii field collation

The currently suggested way to create a postgres field is using `'C'` collation:

```ruby
t.string "ancestry", collation: 'utf8mb4_bin', null: false
t.index "ancestry"
```

### binary collation

Collation of `binary` acts much the same way as the `binary` column:

```ruby
t.string "ancestry", collate: 'binary', limit: 3000, null: false
t.index  "ancestry"
```

### binary column

```ruby
t.binary "ancestry", limit: 3000, null: false
t.index  "ancestry"
```

### ascii character set

Mysql supports per column character sets. Using a character set of `ascii` will
set this up.

```SQL
ALTER TABLE table
  ADD COLUMN ancestry VARCHAR(2700) CHARACTER SET ascii;
```

# Ancestry Formats

You can choose from 2 ancestry formats:

- `:materialized_path` - legacy format (currently the default for backwards compatibility reasons)
- `:materialized_path2` - newer format. Use this if it is a new column

```
:materialized_path    1/2/3,  root nodes ancestry=nil
    descendants SQL: ancestry LIKE '1/2/3/%' OR ancestry = '1/2/3'
:materialized_path2  /1/2/3/, root nodes ancestry=/
    descendants SQL: ancestry LIKE '/1/2/3/%'
```

If you are unsure, choose `:materialized_path2`. It allows a not NULL column,
faster descenant queries, has one less `OR` statement in the queries, and
the path can be formed easily in a database query for added benefits.

There is more discussion in [Internals](#internals) or [Migrating ancestry format](#migrate-ancestry-format)
For migrating from `materialized_path` to `materialized_path2` see [Ancestry Column](#ancestry-column)

## Migrating Ancestry Format

To migrate from `materialized_path` to `materialized_path2`:

```ruby
klass = YourModel
# set all child nodes
klass.where.not(klass.arel_table[klass.ancestry_column].eq(nil)).update_all("#{klass.ancestry_column} = CONCAT('#{klass.ancestry_delimiter}', #{klass.ancestry_column}, '#{klass.ancestry_delimiter}')")
# set all root nodes
klass.where(klass.arel_table[klass.ancestry_column].eq(nil)).update_all("#{klass.ancestry_column} = '#{klass.ancestry_root}'")

change_column_null klass.table_name, klass.ancestry_column, false
```

# Migrating from plugin that uses parent_id column

Most current tree plugins use a parent_id column (has_ancestry,
awesome_nested_set, better_nested_set, acts_as_nested_set). With Ancestry it is
easy to migrate from any of these plugins. To do so, use the
`build_ancestry_from_parent_ids!` method on your ancestry model.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>

1.  Add ancestry column to your table
    *   Create migration: **rails g migration [add_ancestry_to_](table)
        ancestry:string**
    *   Add index to migration: **add_index [table], :ancestry** (UP) /
        **remove_index [table], :ancestry** (DOWN)
    *   Migrate your database: **rake db:migrate**


2.  Remove old tree gem and add in Ancestry to Gemfile
    *   See 'Installation' for more info on installing and configuring gems


3.  Change your model
    *   Remove any macros required by old plugin/gem from
        `[app/models/](model).rb`
    *   Add to `[app/models/](model).rb`: `has_ancestry`


4.  Generate ancestry columns
    *   In rails console: **[model].build_ancestry_from_parent_ids!**
    *   Make sure it worked ok: **[model].check_ancestry_integrity!**


5.  Change your code
    *   Most tree calls will probably work fine with ancestry
    *   Others must be changed or proxied
    *   Check if all your data is intact and all tests pass


6.  Drop parent_id column:
    *   Create migration: `rails g migration [remove_parent_id_from_](table)`
    *   Add to migration: `remove_column [table], :parent_id`
    *   Migrate your database: `rake db:migrate`

# Internals

Ancestry stores a path from the root to the parent for every node.
This is a variation on the materialised path database pattern.
It allows Ancestry to fetch any relation (siblings,
descendants, etc.) in a single SQL query without the complicated algorithms
and incomprehensibility associated with left and right values. Additionally,
any inserts, deletes and updates only affect nodes within the affected node's
own subtree.

In the example above, the `ancestry` column is created as a `string`. This puts a
limitation on the depth of the tree of about 40 or 50 levels. To increase the
maximum depth of the tree, increase the size of the `string` or use `text` to
remove the limitation entirely. Changing it to a text will however decrease
performance because an index cannot be put on the column in that case.

The materialised path pattern requires Ancestry to use a 'like' condition in
order to fetch descendants. The wild character (`%`) is on the right of the
query, so indexes should be used.
